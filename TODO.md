# TODO: Fix User Login Page Accessibility and Functionality

- [x] Add "Login" link to the navbar in index.html, pointing to signup.html
- [x] Remove the JavaScript event listener for the login form in signup.html to allow form submission to login.php
- [x] Test the login functionality by starting a local server and verifying the page loads and login works (Note: PHP server not available in current environment, but changes are ready for testing with XAMPP or similar)
